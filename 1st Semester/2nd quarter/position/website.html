    <h2>What is Corruption?</h2>
    <p>
      Corruption refers to the abuse of power by individuals in authority—such as government officials or business leaders—for personal gain. 
      It includes dishonest acts like bribery, embezzlement, fraud, and influence peddling.
      These behaviors undermine public trust, distort decision-making, and can lead to serious social and economic consequences. 
      Whether isolated or widespread, corruption weakens institutions and erodes accountability.

  <h2>The Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of public funds – Corruption diverts money away from essential programs, weakening national development and economic stability.</li>
  <li>Inequality and injustice – It disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, deepening social divides and denying fair treatment.</li>
  <li>Poor public services – Mismanagement and bribery lead to underfunded healthcare, education, and infrastructure, reducing quality of life.</li>
  <li>Erosion of trust in government – Citizens lose confidence in institutions, leading to political apathy, unrest, and weakened democracy.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Information & Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Raising awareness about corruption is essential for change. When people understand its impact—like poor services, inequality, and loss of trust—they’re more likely to demand transparency and accountability.
      Education, media, and civic involvement help promote integrity and challenge abuse. Awareness is the foundation of reform—learn, share, and inspire others to stay informed.

    <p>Learn, share, and inspire others to stay informed — because awareness is the foundation of reform.</p>
